randcnf -- a tool for random CNFs
Joshua Blinkhorn 22.04.2019

Compile the tool by calling `make' at the command line.

Run the tool by specifying four non-negative integers:

randcnf <num_formulas> <num_vars> <num_clauses> <clause_width>

num_formulas: the number of formulas to be created
num_variables: the number of variables in each formula
num_clauses: the number of clauses in each formula
clause_width: the number of literals in each clause
